# Actos-landing-page

# Landing Page - HTML/SCSS

I wanted to learn sass with a concrete project. This website is part of a course by [@Ziratsu](https://github.com/Ziratsu).
It's a landing page, with a presentation of a fictional business called "Actos". On the main page, you could read why you should choose their solution, a call to action section, and an animated 'on click' FAQ. They are two more pages, on which you can choose a price plan, subscribe to a newsletter (non functionnal), and find more information about the solution.

The website is published on Git Pages: https://git-baptiste.github.io/Actos-landing-page/index.html 


## Things I learned
  
  - Sass: how it truely works on a concrete project.
  - Using mixins (not a lot), placeholders, variables.
  - How to compile scss in a css file with the 'sass --watch' command.
  - Using a good and a convenient structure for light websites ( ie. using a single global.scss file to compile, in which multiple scss file are imported, etc...)
